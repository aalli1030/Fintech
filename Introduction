##Data
Data extracted from Lending Club include information from loan application such as interest rate, installment, the length of loan, etc.

## Methodology
During data cleaning and exploring, I used Pandas and created Pandas data frame to modify it. Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly were introduced for data visulization. 
Sklearn and XGBoost were used for data modeling.

## Result
The model has approximately 70% accuracy when predicting loan's status.
